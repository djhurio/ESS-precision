# ESS Precision Evaluation

## About

This is a code repository for the precision evaluation of the [European Social Survey](https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/).

The evaluation using the code is done for rounds since round 7 (2014) and all countries in one go. The same methodology is used for all rounds and countries. The evaluation results are revised with any change in precision evaluation methodology.

The evaluation for a specific round and country is possible if:

- the survey data for a specific country is included in the round's integrated file,
- the sample data (SDDF) is available for a specific round and country,
- the sample data (SDDF) fulfils the following criteria:
    - it is possible to merge the survey and sample data files,
    - PSU information is available for all respondents.

## History

This is a fork from the [ESS](https://github.com/djhurio/ESS) project which is not usable anymore because of the change in [the ESS data dissemination model](https://github.com/ropensci/essurvey/issues/56).
